# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Failure: Generic Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when using the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command.  The error message provided by the CLI is often unhelpful, making diagnosis challenging. This example highlights the problem and offers a potential solution.

## Problem
The `expo prebuild` command unexpectedly fails without clear indication of the cause.  This can be due to various factors, including:

* Incorrect project configuration
* Conflicting or outdated dependencies
* Problems with native modules

## Solution
The solution often involves carefully reviewing the project's configuration files (e.g., `app.json`, `package.json`) and ensuring all dependencies are compatible and correctly installed.  Cleaning the project's cache and reinstalling dependencies can also be effective.  If the problem persists, examining the logs for more detailed error messages may be necessary.
